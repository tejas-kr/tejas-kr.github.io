# You should be very kind to your juniors, Tejas

Tejas, remember your college days? Back then, you didn’t have anyone to guide you, and you looked up to Priyank Pandey as a mentor. Priyank wasn’t just knowledgeable about software development – he was also approachable and kind, which made all the difference.

Do you remember what you wanted to become back then? I think you do, but maybe you’ve lost sight of it along the way. When a junior asks you for help, try imagining yourself in their place. They might be under a lot of pressure, and your kind words or actions could offer them a moment of peace. Even a small gesture from you might help them through a tough time.

The beauty of kindness is that it doesn’t demand anything in return. It doesn’t matter what others think of your actions – what matters is that you show up and help, without expecting anything back.

Can you honestly say you got to where you are today all by yourself? I don’t think so. While your hard work and perseverance got you far, others must have supported you along the way. Now it’s your turn to give back.

You don’t need to do much – just be kind, empathetic, and genuine with your juniors. Offer your help without any ulterior motives.

In the end, kindness costs nothing but has the power to change everything. Be the mentor you once sought – not just for them, but for the person you always wanted to become.
